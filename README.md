# oblivion
An adventure game written in Prolog. It is roughly based based on the book "Adventure in Prolog" 
and the game Nani Search by Dennis Merritt but with a completely different setting and several
features and riddles added. I used it for my teaching and lectures in Prolog.
The code is fully commented and the comments, as well as the Game are in German.  
It is tested wih SWI-Prolog.

## INSTALLATION / HOW TO USE
Clone or download the repository, in the terminal navigate to the folder, start SWI Prolog (swipl) and consult oblivion.pl.
Start the game by typing 'oblivion'.
